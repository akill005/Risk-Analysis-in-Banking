# 🏦 Client Risk Analysis Dashboard – Power BI Project

This project presents an **interactive Power BI dashboard** that analyzes **client risk levels** within a banking dataset. It explores how customer attributes like income, loyalty classification, age group, occupation, and banking relationship type contribute to their **risk weighting**.

---

## 📌 Objective

To perform **risk segmentation and profiling** of banking clients based on various demographic, financial, and behavioral parameters. The goal is to identify high-risk segments and derive actionable insights for smarter lending and customer relationship decisions.

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies

- **Power BI** – For data visualization, dashboard design, and DAX measures
- **Power Query** – For data cleaning and transformation
- **Excel (.xlsx)** – As the primary dataset source

## 📊 Key Insights from the Dashboard

- **High Income ≠ Low Risk**: Clients with high income showed the **highest average risk**, likely due to higher exposure through business lending or multiple products.
- **Loyalty Classification Impacts Risk**: Clients with lower loyalty tiers (e.g., *Jade*) were more likely to be high-risk, whereas *Platinum* clients showed the lowest average risk.
- **Banking Relationship**: *Retail* banking clients were the **least risky**, while *Institutional* and *Commercial* clients had higher risk scores.
- **Occupation Matters**: Professions like *Food Chemist*, *Compensation Analyst*, and *Software Engineer* were associated with higher risk levels.
- **Age Group Trends**: *Young Adults* and *Adults* had slightly higher risk compared to *Seniors* or *Middle-aged* clients.
